         <div id="info"><b>
           <p>Narendra Modi was born on 17 September, 1950 in Vadnagar, Gujarat to a lower-middle-class family of grocers. He has proved that success has nothing to do with caste, creed or where a person belongs to. He is the first Prime Minister of India whose mother was alive when he took office. In the Lok Sabha, he represents Varanasi constituency and considered as a master strategist for his party. Since 2014, he is current Prime Minister of India and prior to it he had served as the Chief Minister of Gujarat state from 2001 to 2014.</p>
           <p>He is a ray of hope in the lives of billions of Indians and one of the most popular leaders who mostly focuses on development. Even the slogan of our PM Narendra Modi "Main Bhi Chowkidar" focuses on the dignity of labour and aims to take the support of working class. He said this slogan because he felt that he is also standing firm and doing his work as the nation's 'chowkidar'. Further he emphasised that every Indian who is fighting for corruption, dirt, social evils etc. for the progress of India is also a 'Chowkidar.</p></b>
           <q>Each one of us has a natural instinct to rise, like a flame of the lamp. Let‚Äôs nurture this instinct.</q><span>- Narendra Modi</span>
           <p><b>In his childhood days, he had faced several difficulties and obstacles, but he took all the challenges positively and transformed them into opportunities by courage and strength. After joining RSS, he learned the spirit of selflessness, social responsibility, dedication and nationalism.</b></p>
